### NextJS Intro

NextJS was a framework that was introduced because of some `minor inconviniences` in React

1.  In a React project, you have to maintain a separate Backend project for your API routes

2.  React does not provide out of the box routing (you have to use react-router-dom)

3.  React is not SEO Optimised

1.  not exactly true today because of React Server components
2.  weâ€™ll discuss soon why

4.  Waterfalling problem

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
